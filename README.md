# What is TonnetzViz?</div>

TonnetzViz is an app that visualizes music in real time using the Tonnetz.

The "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz" Tonnetz is a diagram representing tonal space.

It can be used to visualize harmonic relationships in music. Each node in the diagram corresponds to one of the 12 tones and is connected to 6 adjacent nodes. The &lsquo;neighbours&rsquo; of each tone are related to it either by a third (major or minor), or by a perfect fifth, dependingon their relative position in the diagram.

One of the interesting properties of the Tonnetz is that any combination of tones (e.g. a chord or a melodic idea) forms a &lsquo;shape&rsquo; that is unchanged by transposition. For instance, in the default layout, every major tria downward-pointing triangle, and every minor triad is an upward-pointing triangle.

# How to use

You can use TonnetzViz with any MIDI-enabled instrument (as long as your browser supports the Web MIDI API). Just connect the instrument to your computer, go to <a href="#controls" class="tab-link">Controls</a>, select the appropriate MIDI port and play. You can also connect TonnetzViz to a software sequencer using a virtual loopback MIDI port.

If you don't have a MIDI device, you can use your computer keyboard to control the app (see < href="#controls">Controls). You can also turn on <to href="#sound" >sound to hear what you are playing.
