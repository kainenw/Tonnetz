# Tonnetz Chord Visualizer

A web app that leverages the Tonnetz to explore chords and their transformations, emphasizing parsimonious voice leading and intuitive visualization.

## Overview

* **Purpose:** Provide a tool for music enthusiasts, students, and composers to understand chord relationships and discover new harmonic possibilities.
* **Features:**
    * Interactive Tonnetz diagram for visualizing chords and their transformations.
    * 23 transformation buttons representing basic and efficient chord movements.
    * Sound playback with Jzz.js for an auditory component.  

## Technologies Used

* **Custom Libraries:**
    * hertz.js (Note-to-frequency conversion)
    * Transformation.js (Chord manipulation based on P, L, R principles)
* **External Libraries:**
    * Jzz.js (Sound generation)
    * Tonnetz-vis (Grid visualization)

## Project Highlights

* **Focus on Efficiency:** Prioritizes parsimonious voice leading for smooth chord transitions.
* **Unique Transformations:** Offers a custom set of transformations for exploring harmonic space in a music theory context.
* **Multisensory Experience:** Combines visual and auditory elements for deeper understanding.

## Future Work 

* **Clickable Interface:**  Add interactive Tonnetz with Konva.js for direct chord input.
* **Chord Progressions:**  Enable the creation and playback of chord sequences.
* **Counterpoint Integration:** Incorporate your counterpoint work for richer harmonic movement generation.
